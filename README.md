# TSP Tour Calculator

This program uses the branch and bound technique to find the optimal Traveling Salesperson Tour (TSP) tour for a set of points. It has an upper limit of 20 points for performance reasons. 
Simply left click to add a point into the grid, right click on a point to remove it from consideration. Click clear to get rid of all points in contention and click tour to construct the TSP tour.
You can also manually add points in using the number fields in the bottom bar, simply click on each and it'll add the point in.
If you need more space than given, you can middle-click and drag on the grid to move around.

I enjoyed making the Sprites to give the program an 8-bit aesthetic and I hope this implementation is useful or fun to play around with.

Credits: I did not invent the Branch and Bound Technique and based my implementation on the description of it given in Alan Tucker's "Applied Combinatorics".
